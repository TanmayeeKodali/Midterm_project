## Instructions 
This repository contains the data, code, and outputs for the Midterm Project #2. 

## Initial code description

`code/01_make_table1.R`
- Generates a table summarizing the `CLASIFFICATION_FINAL` variable
  (counts and percentages for each classification category).
- Output is saved as `classification_summary.csv` in the `output/tables/` folder.

`code/01_make_figure1.R`
- Generates a bar plot showing the distribution of the `CLASIFFICATION_FINAL` variable.
- Output is saved as `classification_distribution.png` in the `output/figures/` folder.

`code/02_make_table2.R`
- Generates a table about CFR comparison with/without comorbidities.
- Output is saved as 'cfr_by_comorbidity.rds' in the output/tables/ folder.

`code/02_make_figure2.R`
- Generates a bar chart of top five comorbidities (%).
